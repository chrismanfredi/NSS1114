One thing people under estimate is the fact that they use simple passwords and that makes your system very vulnerable. The password standard is 8 characters both upper and lower case, one or more numerical digits, and one or more special characters. Typically humans follow patterns, therefor it makes you very vulnerable to hackers because they can guess your password or find it out easier. To prevent hackers from hacking your password make it so your password follows the password standard and make all your passwords different. \'a0}
