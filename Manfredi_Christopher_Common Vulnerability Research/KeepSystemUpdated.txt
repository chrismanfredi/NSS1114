Always keep any program or system up to date with the latest patches! The latest patches always make it so you are more protected in every way. If your software is out of date you are 10x more vulnerable to hackers and viruses. There are a few risks you take by not updating your software fully to the latest version. For example as i said before you are more vulnerable to hackers and viruses, you are also run into the risk of it freezing more often and your program running slower. To get around this keep up to date with the company website and the latest patches.}
